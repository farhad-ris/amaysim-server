# amaysim-server


This is a simple Flask API to return a json response to a GET request at http://0.0.0.0:5000/json.
To run this server you need to have Python 3.6 and pip installed then follow the following direction to run the server.
I have used Intellij as IDE if you use the same do not forget to set the working directory and virtual environment correctly. 

## Run
```shell
$ source ~/the-url-to-the-project-folder/amaysim-server/venv/bin/activate
$ cd ~/the-url-to-the-project-folder/amaysim-server/
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python amaysim-server.py
```
